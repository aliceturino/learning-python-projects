Stuff that I've been doing while learning Python:


<ul> <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <li><code>datetime-archives.py</code> = Creates an empty file with date and time, using an extension of user's preference.</li>
  <li><code>dictionary/dictionary.py</code>Asks the user for a word and returns the meaning of that word by reading a json file and using the difflib module.</li>
  <li><code>dictionary/dictionary.json</code>JSON file used in </code>dictionary.py<code></li>
  
</ul>
